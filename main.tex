\maketitle

We introduce a group homomorphism from $B(G)^\times$, the unit group of the Burnside ring of a group to $O(T(G,G))$, the orthogonal unit group of the representation ring of $p$-permutation $(kG,kG)$ bimodules, which generates $p$-permutation equivalences between $kG$ and $kG$. Robert Boltje provided a construction of $p$-permutation equivalences via splendid Rickard equivalences. In the case of abelian groups, we provide a lift of this construction, associating to each element of $B(G)^\times$ a splendid Rickard equivalence for which is sent to the corresponding $p$-permutation equivalence.
